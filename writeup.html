<br>

<p><hr><p><h2>Abstract</h2><p><hr><p>
    For our final project, we created a web-based, player-versus-player racing game with the ThreeJS library. We were inspired
    by the gameplay mechanics and design of Nintendo’s Mario Kart franchise as well as the split-screen multiplayer gameplay and
    style of COS 426 Spring 2019’s ColoRing. As such, we implemented two-player keyboard controls, split-screen functionality,
    driving mechanics, collision physics, a basic track, moving obstacles, consumable power-ups, a lap counter, as well as start
    and end menus. We applied a colorful design inspired by the famous Rainbow Road from the Mario Kart series.

<p><hr><p><a name='Introduction'></a><h2>Introduction</h2><p><hr><p>
<p><hr><p><a name='Goal'></a><h3>Goal</h3><p><hr><p>
    Our primary goal was to create a fun and visually appealing game similar to the non-realistic racing games we played when
    we were younger. We were also very set on producing a multiplayer game. Given the current pandemic and social distancing
    becoming ubiquitous in our society as a result, we wanted to produce something that could bring people together (even if
    just those in the same home) and take their minds off of the many additional stresses people are feeling in these trying times.
    <br><br>
    As such, any potential user looking for an enjoyable experience would benefit. As would anyone looking to best a friend or family
    member in a casual competition. Alternatively, anyone looking to create a similar game could take note of our approaches in
    implementing the core components of our project and extend our ideas even further or consider some alternative approaches that
    would work even better.

<p><hr><p><a name='Previous Work'></a><h3>Previous Work</h3><p><hr><p>
    As mentioned above, our game follows in the footsteps of Mario Kart and other non-realistic racing games. Many components of
    our game, including the driving controls, consumable power-ups, moving obstacles, track, and the player models themselves were
    inspired by such games. We were also inspired by the split-screen player-versus-player set-up and color theme in ColoRing from
    Spring 2019. Both of these aspects were incorporated into our game.
    <br><br>
    Both Mario Kart (and related games), as well as ColoRing, succeed in their gameplay mechanics, including their handling of
    collisions between objects and movement physics. Likewise, both are extremely visually pleasing and provide an enjoyable
    experience to the player(s). We believe we have successfully incorporated these elements into our project.

<p><hr><p><a name='Approach'></a><h3>Approach</h3><p><hr><p>
    Since we created a racing game, the core features of our project are the driving mechanics and collision physics. Both of
    these allow the player to move about and interact with the track, obstacles, and power-ups. Our approach was to implement
    a basic two-dimensional physics in three-dimensional space. Like in Assignment 5, we keep track of the total net forces on
    the player and update their position using Verlet integration. We also using bounding boxes to detect collisions with the
    track walls, obstacles, power-ups, and between players. Upon detecting a collision, we apply a bounce force to the player(s)
    involved in the collision.
    <br><br>
    We believe that such an approach should work well in a basic, planar setting with relatively few collisions with basic objects.
    In other words, we thought it would work well in precisely the setting we were seeking to create: our track is planar, we only
    have two players, we use basic geometries (ThreeJS primitives) for most of our objects. Our approach should work well under
    these circumstances precisely because of the relative simplicity. Of course, this is not to disparage what we have created; we
    are merely observing that good results can be achieved with simple techniques. Using this relatively simple approach, we could
    focus most of our attention on the gameplay. We focused on the physics enough to make the game playable and realisitc, and put
    our main attention on making the game fun by ensuring the ability to race worked well and there were multiple features to keep
    the players entertained. 


<p><hr><p><a name='Methodology'></a><h2>Methodology</h2><p><hr><p>
<p><hr><p><a name='Start and End Menus'></a><h3>Start and End Menus</h3><p><hr><p>
    One piece of the game that we implemented was the Start and End menus, allowing the players to input their names, as well
as refresh the game if they wish to play a second time. There was the potential to implement this piece in many different ways,
including showing a mini canvas over the game before it starts and after it ends, while manipulating the opacity of the menus.
The implementation that we decided to go with was creating three different canvases that fit the entire window: the start menu,
the game scene, and the game over menu. The key was that only one of the canvases would be displayed at a single time. The
start menu is the first canvas to be displayed, while the other canvases are initially set to display: “none”. Then, on the
press of the PLAY button, the function switches the display from the start menu to the in-game scene. Finally, we have a
function that decides when the end of the game is reached (which is related to the lap counter of each of the players). Once
the end of the game is reached, we once again switch which canvas is displayed, this time from the in-game scene to the game
over scene. All of these canvas creations and style manipulations are done by altering the HTML indirectly through the
javascript files (without needing to create more html files). We decided to go with this implementation for a few reasons.
For one, we felt that having separate full-sized screens for the different stages of the game allowed for better flow, and a
little bit more creative flexibility. Furthermore, we aimed to place all of the HTML manipulation within the same javascript
files as all of the other functions of the game in order to keep all of the similar modules close together. For our individual
needs, having certain functions (like creating the canvases as well as showing them) close together made debugging a bit
easier, especially considering none of us had a lot of HTML/CSS experience from the past.

<p><hr><p><a name='Countdown'></a><h3>Countdown</h3><p><hr><p>
    When the play button is pressed, a timer is initialised in the scene to prevent players from moving until the three beeps in the
  song have played. While the timer decreases, a countdown on the screen is updated depending on the amount of time left. The countdown
  starts at 3, and the opacity is determined based on the time this number was put up, and the next number is scheduled to appear so that
  the number starts completely opaque then becomes completely transparent. This is placed in the centre of the screen so that the players
  can both see it and know when to start racing.

<p><hr><p><a name='Cameras'></a><h3>Cameras</h3><p><hr><p>
    We use two perspective cameras that follow each player as they drive around the track. This is achieved by setting a relative
    offset position for the camera from the player and making the camera a child of the player so as the players move and their
    positions are updated, so are the positions of their corresponding cameras. The two cameras are used to achieve the split screen
    functionality with the left half of the screen corresponding to player one’s camera and the right half corresponding to player
    two’s camera.
    <br><br>
    We sought to recreate the standard third-person point-of-view that is standard in racing games. Not only is this familiar to
    players, it lets them better see the track, obstacles, and power-ups. While this is of course better for the gameplay experience,
    it also lets the player better see and enjoy the aesthetic we so carefully created.
    <br><br>
    Added to each camera object was an audio listener object. The listener for the first camera was used to play the background music
    (found from SoundCloud and cited below) while the listener for the second camera played the engine sounds (also cited below), which
    are actually the motor of a string trimmer for landscaping.

<p><hr><p><a name='Split Screen'></a><h3>Split Screen</h3><p><hr><p>
    We added a split screen by having each player take a camera object as an argument, so the player created has a camera in a different
  position that provides a different view of the same scene. When updating the scene at each interval, the scene is rendered from each
  camera perspective, and the results are shown on two sides of the screen separated by a vertical split halfway along the screen width.

<p><hr><p><a name='Road'></a><h3>Road</h3><p><hr><p>
    In creating our track, there were a number of implementations that we considered. One ambitious implementation would have
    been to use a parametric geometry. While itself a ThreeJS primitive, this geometry could have allowed us to create truly
    complex tracks that would have rivaled commercial racing games. However, doing so would have been very complex and could
    have forced us to reconsider our approach to the driving physics.
    <br><br>
    The approach we ended up going with was from our MVP: we used a ring geometry to create a basic circular track. A clear
    advantage of this approach was its simplicity. By saving time with the geometry, we could focus more on aesthetic and
    other core components of the game, like getting the driving and collisions right. To make up for this simplicity, we used
    a shader material with a rainbow fragment shader from ShaderToy to create the track mesh. This is how our track is
    reminiscent of Mario Kart’s Rainbow Road.
    <br><br>
    This ring shape also made it easy to create track walls. We used two torus geometries for the walls and merged them together
    to increase efficiency. Keeping with the theme, we used a MeshNormalMaterial to create a rainbow effect seen on the walls.
    <br><br>
    Lastly, the start line/lap indicator was created with a simple plane geometry placed just above the track surface with a
    checkerboard texture mapped onto it.

<p><hr><p><a name='Player'></a><h3>Player</h3><p><hr><p>
    For our player movements, we decided that we took inspiration from the Cloth Simulation assignment and used Verlet integration
  to move the player depending on the forces acting on it. This seemed like a good approach because it would give us complete
  control over which forces we could apply to the player, and the movement would be updated for any type of force. Alternative
  approaches could have been to use existing implementation to handle driving physics by using Physijs or Cannon, but we decided on
  this approach because we already have some experience in it and felt that we would have more flexibility in different types of
  forces. Some advantages to these other approaches are that they could simulate the physics in our game more accurately, but after
  implementing this we were satisfied with the movement generated so decided to continue with it.

<p><hr><p><a name='Collisions'></a><h3>Collisions</h3><p><hr><p>
    We handled our collisions in the scene object, as there are many objects that can collide within the scene and there are different
  results depending on the objects that collide. To detect collisions between one player and scene meshes, we modified some public code
  from <a href="https://github.com/stemkoski/stemkoski.github.com/blob/master/Three.js/Collision-Detection.html">GitHub</a>. Since
  the player uses a model rather than a mesh, we created a bounding rectangle around each player to detect collisions.
  We then checked for collisions by taking each vertex in the players mesh, creating a ray and checking whether it intersects with
  collidable meshes in the scene which are stored as a scene attribute. This includes the walls, moving objects, and spikes. If there is
  a collision with a spike the player’s spin function is called. If there’s a collision with the road edge, the player’s road bounce
  function is called, causing the player to rebound off the side of the road. We tried numerous approaches to get a realistic bounce effect.
  The first implementation we tried was taking the normal to the mesh collided with, and adding a force to the player in this direction,
  but the player would often go slightly through the mesh, causing the force to act in the opposite direction. The next implementation we
  tried was to apply a force in the opposite direction to which the player was facing, but this also proved to be challenging and caused
  forces to be applied in unexpected directions. In the end the implementation we settled on was to add a force in the direction from the
  collision position to the centre of the road, which has produced satisfying results. For collisions with scene obstacles and between
  players, the player’s bounce function is called, which uses the first implementation described to rebound the player away from the
  collision normal. The final collidable object is the missile powerup. For this, instead of using a collidable mesh we checked whether
  the missile’s position was within the target player’s position to some threshold, and if so called the player’s spin function and removed
  the missile object from the scene.

<p><hr><p><a name='Controller'></a><h3>Controller</h3><p><hr><p>
    The controller is an object that we used to handle user input. This is where we add our listener events which wait for keys to be
  pressed or released. When a player object is created, they are also given a controller object that will determine how this player is
  affected depending on the user’s input. To allow multiple keys to be pressed at the same time, the keys are added to a dictionary
  which is stored as an attribute of the player, then when the player is updated the functions associated with the keys stored are
  called. Player 1 is controlled by the wasd keys to move and power-ups are used with the space bar. Player 2 is controlled by the arrow
  keys, and power-ups are used with the enter key.

<p><hr><p><a name='Lap Counter'></a><h3>Lap Counter</h3><p><hr><p>
    Yet another piece of the game that we needed to implement in order to complete our approach was the Lap Counter. Since the
goal of winning the game was heavily reliant on the number of laps traversed by a given player (at least in our approach), it
was essential that we made sure there was no way to cheat the system in any way. For example, our first idea was that we could
include an invisible bounding box at the start line, and then simply add the lap count that a player holds if they were to
cross the start line. However, we quickly realized that there is a huge flaw in this logic, and that is a player could easily
drive over the starting line continuously (going backwards and forwards) and accumulate their laps in a cheating manner. To
fix this issue, we decided that it would be best to also include on each player a “Distance travelled in this lap” property,
along with establishing a “Distance Threshold” that the player must drive before being able to earn a lap. We decided that a
good distance threshold is about 75% of the track (using the inner radius as opposed to the outer radius). This way, it is
more beneficial for the player to earn their lap in the organic way, since by the time they are 75% of the way around the
track, it is closer for them to finish the lap by continuing anyway. Once they have collided with the bounding box on the
starting line, we increment their lap count as well as returning the “distance travelled in this lap” property to 0. Before
the bounding box idea, we considered an approach in which we included a plane that the player would intersect. However, given
that our track is circular and a player would cross the plane two times in one lap, there were too many conditions to consider
to really consider this implementation over the bounding box implementation.

<p><hr><p><a name='Power-ups'></a><h3>Power-ups</h3><p><hr><p>
    To add power-ups, we decided that we would have two powerup boxes on the track so each player could get one power-up per lap.
  We made a power-up class that creates a TorusKnot geometry, and added a material to fit our game’s style. An attribute of this
  object is a list of possible power-ups, and when a player collides with the mesh a random string will be taken from the list
  and added to the player’s power-up attribute. After a collision, the power-up item is made transparent, and a timer is activated
  so that the players cannot interact with this mesh again for some time.  Upon receiving the power-up, the player is notified that
  they have it and can choose when to use it through keyboard input. The power-ups we have implemented are:
  <ul>
    <li> boost (speed increases for some time) </li>
    <li> zap (opponent’s speed decreases for some time) </li>
    <li> freeze (opponent cannot move for some time) </li>
    <li> spike (cone meshes placed on the track behind the player) </li>
    <li> triple spike (three cone meshes placed on the track behind the player) </li>
    <li> add lap (players lap count increases) </li>
    <li> remove lap (opponent’s lap count decreases) </li>
    <li> reverse controls (opponent’s controls are reversed, so forward is back and steering left turns the kart right etc.) </li>
    <li> missile (this player fires a sphere mesh at the other player, which updates at each step to move towards the player) </li>
  </ul>
  <br>Upon colliding with a spike or missile object, the player’s spin attribute is activated, causing them to complete a full 360 turn
   during which they cannot move.</br>

<p><hr><p><a name='Obstacles'></a><h3>Obstacles</h3><p><hr><p>
    To make the gameplay more interesting, we created three moving objects that move along the track, as well as up and down
    through the road, and can stop the players in their tracks if they are not careful to avoid them.
    <br><br>
    Of course, there were many directions we could have taken this in. We could have created different types of obstacles,
    including walls that drop down at random (or regular) intervals, objects of different sizes, etc. In the end, given how
    small our track is, we thought that three octahedrons moving along and through the track added enough complexity to make
    the game more interesting, but not too much so as to make the game frustrating or exceedingly difficult.
    <br><br>
    For material, we used the MeshNormalMaterial (as with the road walls and power-ups) to keep with our theme. In order to
    achieve the movement, we use sinusoidal functions varying with the timestamp. To achieve the circular orbit around the
    track, we use the parametric equation of a circle. We also use sinusoidal functions in the y direction to get the object
    to bob up and down through the track. The positions of the meshes are set in our update function for the class.

<p><hr><p><a name='Results'></a><h2>Results</h2><p><hr><p>
    As a whole, we measured success by the playability of the game, and just how fun it was for us and others to race together.
On a smaller scale, we were able to measure success daily because we continuously met and set goals for ourselves for what
needed to be done at each different stage. We were also able to better measure success through small experiments such as
testing with friends and family members. External feedback is one of the most valuable sources of criticism, especially when
we are stuck looking at the same thing for hours on end. More experiments include testing certain corner cases or conditions
(such as what happens when more than one button is pressed, when player hits ball and uses powerup, etc). Overall, our results
indicate that not only is our game playable, but that it can be exciting for both of the players.

<p><hr><p><a name='Conclusion'></a><h2>Conclusion</h2><p><hr><p>
    Overall, the approach that we took is promising - the game is playable and enjoyable. The power ups provide an exciting
feature to the table, as do the obstacles to avoid, and the colors help bring the track to life. That being said, another
approach that may have proved better is using Physijs, Cannon for the physics. These two libraries handle collisions better
than our current bounding box implementation, which are not 100% accurate and do sprout occasional bugs. Furthemore, those
driving physics libraries offer more realistic steering than our current form. Some followup work that should be done next
would definitely include these driving/steering/collision improvements. So maybe re-writing with Physijs implementation.
There are also many other improvements/next steps to consider. A different road shape would add a LOT more to the game
(constantly going left the whole way gets boring fairly quickly). However, changing the track shape adds a lot of complexity
to our implementation, and would require a rework essentially. Some more next steps could be to add better sound effects, such
as for collisions, powerups, lap traversal, etc. Another big next step is to make the menus look prettier, since right now
they are very minimal in style. Overall, we learned so much during this project! For one, we have a much better understanding
of HTML - adding text to the screen and styling it, as well as navigating in the web browser (adding buttons, etc.). We also
are able to load models and textures from raw files. But perhaps the biggest thing we learned is the process and components
that go into rendering a scene in THREE.js. Understanding how a renderer, camera, and scene work together to display animations
and images on the screen is something that many students come into this course looking forward to, and this knowledge is
perhaps the most valuable.
